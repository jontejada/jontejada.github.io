two ways to create regex in javascript:

{% highlight javascript %}
var re1 = /ab+c/; //regex literal enclosed by forward slashes
var re2 = new RegExp("ab+c"); //constructor function of RegExp obj
``{% end highlight %}


- **literal** character/string being searched for
- **metacharacter** special character with meaning other than literal
- **target string** string being searched
- **escape sequence**
- **search expression** regular expression with search pattern

##12 metacharacters:
|       | 12 metacharacters | usage |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| `\` | backslash | makes following non-metacharacter special **OR** escapes follwing metacharacter to use it literally |
| `^` | caret | matches beginning of input **OR** negates a char class when first char in the set |
| `$` | dollar sign | matches end of input to preceding expression |
| `.` | dot | matches any char except newline, equivalent to `[^\n]` |
| `|` | pipe | **alternation**, equivalent to 'OR'. has lowest precedence
| `*` | asterisk | match preceding expression 0+ times, equivalent to `{0,}` |
| `+` | plus | match preceding expression 1+ times, equivalent to `{1,}` |
| `?` | question mark | match preceding expression 0 or 1 time, equivalent to `{0,1}`. *see also non-greedy, lookahead assertions*
| `( )` | parenthesis | **capture  group** is matched and remembered for backreference
| `[ ]` | bracket | **char class/set** will match for one character position once |
| `-` | dash | range separator inside a char class
| `{` | open curly brace |

##notes on character classes `[]`
* to test for literal dash inside a char set, it must come first or last (and without a `/`), i.e. `[-abc]`
* shorthand char classes:
	* `/d` is short for `[0-9]` (ASCII digits in javascript)
	* `/w`
