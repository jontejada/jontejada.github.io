#model view controller (MVC) and  the single page application (SPA)

##separation of concerns

* database with user lives in the model. has name, email, password, etc

* view is what the user sees, i.e. html templates

* controller has routes(?) 

* layered cake analogy  

##Model 
* first place to work on a new project
* define and establish organization of data
* want an accurate representaiton of real world
* but also easy for programmers to manipulate

##View
* anything seen by the user
* HTML, EJS
* users might interact with views

##Controller
* routing is most common function
	* ex --logic for a login page that will fetch user data

#Micro-services
* result of the rise of APIs
* small standalone applications served from same webserver code
* separate concerns of keeping data model
* several little view/controller jellybeans
