##intro

These are notes about using git and github hosted repos as a collaborative tool. They were written while working on [nearmeow](http://www.nearmeow.com).

From the [git repo] readme:

> Git - the stupid content tracker
>
> "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
>
> - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
>   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
>   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
> - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
>   dictionary of slang.
> - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
>   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
> - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

______________________________________________

##steps taken in the [example repo](https://github.com/jontejada/git_github_work)
1. created new repo (on github)
2. wrote and commited readme.md and .env files (on github)
3. cloned (locally)
4. edited readme.md and wrote to a new js file (locally)
5. added and commited changes (locally)
6. branched (on github)
7. edited readme.md and wrote to a new js file in master (on github)
8. commited changes to the branch (on github)
9. `git fetch --all` to [fetch all remote branches] (locally, from here on)
	- equivalent to `git remote update` [more info](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2688251/what-is-the-difference-between-git-fetch-origin-and-git-remote-update-origin)
10. optional `git branch -a` to see full list of branches 
11. `git branch --track firstBranch origin/firstBranch` to make new branch and set it to track the corresponding remote branch
12. optional `git checkout firstBranch` to switch to that branch
13. optional `git diff` or `git difftool`
14. `git config merge.conflictstyle diff3` to set the default style of merging
15. from master, `merge firstBranch`
16. optional `git merge --abort` to abandon attempted merge, otherwise add, commit, push

##about the [git index] aka staging area
- `git status` shows differences between working directory, index and most recent commit
- `git ls-files` shows files in the index

##diff tools
- `git diff` [official doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) & [more](http://www.gitguys.com/topics/git-diff/)
- `git difftool` [official doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool) and [OSX difftool apps]

##merge tools
- `git merge` [official doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge)
- [fix merge conflicts]
