#APIs from the front end
from 2015-11-11 d18

##What is an API?
* [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API)
* any mechanism to ask for something from a program
* not much different from a library, e.g. lodash
	* difference is where the code lives
	* an API doesn't have to be installed
* make a request and get a determistic response
* [Google URL shortener](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/?hl=en) is an example of a non-data API that is library like 
* SDK or devkit makes it easier
	* from Facebook sdk:

```
<script>
// Only works after `FB.init` is called
function myFacebookLogin() {
 FB.login(function(){}, {scope: 'publish_actions'});
}
</script>
<button onclick="myFacebookLogin()">Login with Facebook</button>
```
* Pandora does not have an API

##architectural implications
* increasingly popular, but some negatives
* 90s style static HTML sites are simple, easy, fast
* modern Etsy site adds a suite of requests from your device with css, js, backbone.
	* Then a bespoke API request is made, which triggers a series of serverside requests.
	* A bundled response is returned.

##ex
* `$.get` jquery shorthand AJAX function
