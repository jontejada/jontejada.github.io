Semantic versioning is way to specify software features and compatibility with a three part version number. There are specifications for each of the three numbers, as set out by [semver.org](http://www.semver.org). These images are from a presentation I did at Galvanize.

#offical rules:

#alternative way to remember:

#example timeline

as software is developed / fixed / improved, the version numbers is incremented. when you `npm init`, your package will default to version v1.0.0. An alternative is to start at v0.1.0, which is considered to be in development (v0.x.x).

#package.json

npm [parses](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) the version number. A tilde~ before the version number will allow increments of the **FIX** version, but not to the **BREAKING** or **FEATURE** versions. A caret⌃ will allow increments of both the **FIX** and **FEATURE** versions&#42;. This more liberal behavior will allow backwards-compatible features to be added.

`npm --save some-package` will add the current version of some-package to your package.json appended with a caret⌃.

#&#42;dev mode
When in development (v0.x.x), a caret⌃ will behave like a tilde~, so it will not increment the **FEATURE** version number. This is because, "Anything may change at any time." [More info here](http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/02/npm-no-longer-defaults-to-tildes/)

#SEMVER summary

Please note that these versioning rules are not necessarily followed by any particular piece of software being developed. [For example](https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq), AngularJS allows breaking changes in a new **FEARTURE** version.
